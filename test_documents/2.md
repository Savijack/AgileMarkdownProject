# Fixing an Old Bike

I hadn’t touched the bike in years.

The tires were flat, the chain was rusted, but it still felt *familiar*.

## Steps Taken

1. Pumped the tires
2. Cleaned the chain
3. Tightened the brakes

Here’s what I wrote down while working:

``` file="notes.txt"
tires low
chain rusted
brakes loose
