# Release Checklist

This checklist is for the next release. It mixes *inline emphasis*, **bold warnings**, and simple structure.

---

## Before tagging

1. Update the changelog
2. Run tests (`ctest`)
3. Verify docs build

- Confirm the version string is correct: `v1.8.2`
- Double-check the config defaults are sane
- Make sure the example links work: [YouTube](youtube.com)

---

## Troubleshooting

If the build fails, look for `undefined reference` or `cannot find -l...` first.

If you still can’t figure it out, paste the output into the issue and attach a screenshot.
